%p
  You can read about my strategy
  <a href='http://blog.winthetrophy.com/2009/09/07/andrew-shindyapins-betting-strategy'>here</a>.
  Every time someone visits my url (like you're doing now), I make more bets!
%p I currently have #{@chips} chips available.

- if @chips < 10
  %p Since I have less than 10 chips, I'll try again later.
- else
  %p There are a total of #{@points} points for me to bet on, so I can bet #{@chips_per_point} chips per point.
